/// The `SegmentationDescriptor` is an implementation of a `SpliceDescriptor`. It provides an optional
/// extension to the `TimeSignal` and `SpliceInsert` commands that allows for segmentation messages to
/// be sent in a time/video accurate method. This descriptor shall only be used with the `TimeSignal`,
/// `SpliceInsert` and the `SpliceNull` commands. The `TimeSignal` or `SpliceInsert` message should be
/// sent at least once a minimum of 4 seconds in advance of the signaled `SpliceTime` to permit the
/// insertion device to place the `SpliceInfoSection` accurately. Devices that do not recognize a value
/// in any field shall ignore the message and take no action.
