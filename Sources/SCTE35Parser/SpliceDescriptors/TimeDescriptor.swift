/// The `TimeDescriptor` is an implementation of a `SpliceDescriptor`. It provides an optional extension
/// to the `SpliceInsert`, `SpliceNull` and `TimeSignal` commands that allows a programmer’s wall clock
/// time to be sent to a client. For the highest accuracy, this descriptor should be used with a
/// `TimeSignal` or `SpliceInsert` command that has a `ptsTime` defined.
/// The repetition rate of this descriptor should be at least once every 5 seconds. When it is the only
/// descriptor present in the `TimeSignal` or `SpliceNull` command, then the encoder should not insert a
/// key frame.
/// This command may be used to synchronize time based external metadata with video and the party
/// responsible for the metadata and the time value used should ensure that they are properly
/// synchronized and have the desired level of accuracy required for their application.
///
/// The `TimeDescriptor` uses the time format defined for the Precision Time Protocol [PTP]. [PTP] is
/// based upon an international time scale called International Atomic Time (TAI), unlike NTP [RFC5905]
/// which is based upon UTC. [PTP] is being used in a/v bridging and broadcast synchronization protocols
/// and likely to be available in a studio environment. Other time sources, such as NTP or GPS, are
/// readily convertible to PTP format.
///
/// TAI does not have "leap" seconds like UTC. When UTC was introduced (January 1, 1972) it was
/// determined there should be a difference of 10 seconds between the two time scales. Since then an
/// additional 27 leap seconds (including one in December 2016) have been added to UTC to put the current
/// difference between the two timescales at 37 seconds (as of June 2018) The [PTP] protocol communicates
/// the current offset between TAI and UTC to enable conversion. By default [PTP] uses the same "epoch"
/// (i.e. origination or reference start time and date of the timescale) as Unix time, of 00:00, January
/// 1, 1970. Readers are advised to consult IERS Bulletin C for the current value of leap seconds
/// [https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/Bulletins/bulletins.html].
