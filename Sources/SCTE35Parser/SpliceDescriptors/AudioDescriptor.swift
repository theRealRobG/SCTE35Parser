/// The `AudioDescriptor` should be used when programmers and/or MVPDs do not support dynamic signaling
/// (e.g., signaling of audio language changes) and with legacy audio formats that do not support dynamic
/// signaling. As discussed in Section 9.1.5 of the SCTE Operational Practice on Multiple Audio Signaling
/// [SCTE 248], since most MVPD head-ends do not change the PAT/PMT to signal changed audio streams, this
/// descriptor in SCTE 35 should be used to signal such changes. This descriptor is an implementation of
/// a `SpliceDescriptor`. It provides the ability to dynamically signal the audios actually in use in the
/// stream. This descriptor shall only be used with a `TimeSignal` command and a segmentation descriptor
/// with the type `programStart` or `programOverlapStart`.
