    /// message differs from a `spliceNull` command so that it can easily be handled in a unique way by
    /// receiving equipment (i.e., removed from the multiplex by a satellite receiver). If a descriptor
    /// is sent with this command, it cannot be expected that it will be carried through the entire
    /// transmission chain and it should be a private descriptor that is utilized only by the bandwidth
